Miss	O
Brooke	O
had	O
that	O
kind	O
of	O
beauty	O
which	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
thrown	O
into	O
relief	O
by	O
poor	O
dress	O

Her	O
hand	O
and	O
wrist	O
were	O
so	O
finely	O
formed	O
that	O
she	O
could	O
wear	O
sleeves	O
not	O
less	O
bare	O
of	O
style	O
than	O
those	O
in	O
which	O
the	O
Blessed	O
Virgin	O
appeared	O
to	O
Italian	O
painters	O
;	O
and	O
her	O
profile	O
as	O
well	O
as	O
her	O
stature	O
and	O
bearing	O
seemed	O
to	O
gain	O
the	O
more	O
dignity	O
from	O
her	O
plain	O
garments	O
,	O
which	O
by	O
the	O
side	O
of	O

gave	O
her	O
the	O

She	O
was	O
usually	O
spoken	O
of	O
as	O
being	O
remarkably	O
clever	O

but	O
with	O
the	O
addition	O
that	O
her	O

had	O
more	O

Nevertheless	O

Celia	O
wore	O
scarcely	O

;	O
and	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
to	O

that	O
her	O

there	O

an	O

as	O
a	O
Puritan	O

served	O
under	O

afterwards	O

out	O

the	O

to	O
account	O
for	O

Miss	O

in	O
all	O
her	O

sentiments	O

is	O

to	O
accept	O

any	O

Dorothea	O
knew	O
many	O
passages	O
of	O

of	O
Jeremy	O

by	O

the	O

made	O
the	O
solicitudes	O
of	O
feminine	O
fashion	O
appear	O
an	O
occupation	O
for	O
Bedlam	O

She	O
could	O
not	O
reconcile	O
the	O
anxieties	O
of	O
a	O
spiritual	O
life	O
involving	O
eternal	O
consequences	O

with	O
a	O
keen	O
interest	O
in	O
gimp	O
and	O
artificial	O
protrusions	O
of	O

Her	O
mind	O
was	O
theoretic	O
,	O
and	O
yearned	O
by	O
its	O
nature	O
after	O
some	O
lofty	O
conception	O
of	O
the	O
world	O
which	O
might	O
frankly	O
include	O
the	O
parish	O
of	O
Tipton	O
and	O
her	O
own	O
rule	O
of	O
conduct	O
there	O
;	O
she	O
was	O
enamoured	O
of	O
intensity	O
and	O
greatness	O
,	O
and	O
rash	O
in	O
embracing	O
whatever	O
seemed	O
to	O
her	O
to	O
have	O
those	O
aspects	O

likely	O
to	O
seek	O
martyrdom	O
,	O
to	O
make	O
retractations	O

and	O
then	O
to	O
incur	O
martyrdom	O
after	O
all	O
in	O
a	O
quarter	O
where	O
she	O
had	O
not	O
sought	O
it	O

Certainly	O
such	O
elements	O
in	O
the	O
character	O
of	O
a	O
marriageable	O
girl	O
tended	O
to	O
interfere	O
with	O
her	O
lot	O
,	O
and	O
hinder	O
it	O
from	O
being	O
decided	O
according	O

Mr.	O
Brooke	O
's	O
conclusions	O
were	O
as	O
difficult	O
to	O
predict	O
as	O
the	O
weather	O
:	O
it	O
was	O
only	O
safe	O
to	O
say	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
act	O
with	O
benevolent	O
intentions	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
would	O
spend	O
as	O

as	O
possible	O

about	O

the	O
retention	O
of	O
his	O

he	O

In	O
Mr.	O
Brooke	O
the	O
hereditary	O
strain	O
of	O
Puritan	O
energy	O
was	O
clearly	O
in	O
abeyance	O
;	O
but	O
in	O
his	O
niece	O
Dorothea	O
it	O
glowed	O
alike	O
through	O
faults	O
and	O
virtues	O
,	O
turning	O
sometimes	O
into	O
impatience	O
of	O
her	O

his	O
way	O

the	O

seven	O

Nothing	O
could	O

her	O

and	O
her	O
insistence	O
on	O
