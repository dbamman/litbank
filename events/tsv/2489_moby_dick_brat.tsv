Why	O

Surely	O
all	O

still	O

Again	O
,	O
I	O
always	O
go	O
to	O
sea	O
as	O
a	O
sailor	O
,	O
because	O
they	O
make	O
a	O
point	O
of	O
paying	O
me	O
for	O
my	O
trouble	O
,	O
whereas	O
they	O
never	O
pay	O
passengers	O
a	O

penny	O
that	O
I	O
ever	O
heard	O
of	O

On	O
the	O
contrary	O
,	O
passengers	O
themselves	O
must	O
pay	O

And	O
there	O
is	O
all	O
the	O
difference	O
in	O
the	O
world	O
between	O
paying	O
and	O
being	O
paid	O
.	O

The	O
act	O
of	O
paying	O
is	O
perhaps	O
the	O
most	O
uncomfortable	O
infliction	O
that	O
the	O
two	O
orchard	O
thieves	O
entailed	O
upon	O
us	O
.	O

But	O
being	O
paid	O
,	O
--	O
what	O
will	O
compare	O
with	O
it	O
?	O

The	O
urbane	O
activity	O
with	O
which	O
a	O
man	O
receives	O
money	O
is	O
really	O
marvellous	O
,	O
considering	O
that	O
we	O
so	O
earnestly	O
believe	O
money	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
root	O
of	O
all	O
earthly	O
ills	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
on	O
no	O
account	O
can	O
a	O
monied	O
man	O
enter	O
heaven	O

Ah	O
!	O

how	O
cheerfully	O
we	O
consign	O
ourselves	O
to	O
perdition	O
!	O

Finally	O
,	O
I	O
always	O
go	O
to	O
sea	O
as	O
a	O
sailor	O
,	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
wholesome	O
exercise	O
and	O
pure	O
air	O
of	O
the	O
fore-castle	O

For	O
as	O
in	O

the	O

his	O
atmosphere	O
at	O

from	O
the	O
sailors	O
on	O
the	O

He	O
thinks	O
he	O

it	O
first	O

but	O
not	O
so	O

In	O
much	O
the	O

way	O
do	O
the	O
commonalty	O
lead	O
their	O
leaders	O
in	O
many	O
other	O
things	O
,	O
at	O
the	O

time	O
that	O
the	O
leaders	O
little	O
suspect	O
it	O

But	O
wherefore	O
it	O
was	O
that	O
after	O
having	O
repeatedly	O
smelt	O
the	O
sea	O
as	O
a	O
merchant	O
sailor	O
,	O
I	O
should	O
now	O
take	O
it	O
into	O
my	O
head	O
to	O
go	O
on	O
a	O
whaling	O
voyage	O
;	O
this	O
the	O
invisible	O
police	O

of	O

And	O

doubtless	O

my	O
going	O
on	O
this	O
