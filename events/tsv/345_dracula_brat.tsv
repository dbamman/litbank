Buda-Pesth	O

was	O
that	O

the	O

that	O

had	O

among	O
the	O

regarding	O
Transylvania	O
;	O
it	O

struck	O
me	O
that	O

have	O

I	O
find	EVENT
that	O

in	O

who	O
claim	O

This	O
may	O

an	O

All	O
day	O
long	O
we	O
seemed	O
to	O
dawdle	O
through	O
a	O
country	O
which	O
was	O
full	O
of	O
beauty	O
of	O
every	O
kind	O
.	O

Sometimes	O
we	O
saw	O
little	O
towns	O
or	O
castles	O
on	O
the	O
top	O
of	O
steep	O
hills	O
such	O
as	O
we	O
see	O
in	O
old	O
missals	O
;	O
sometimes	O
we	O
ran	O
by	O
rivers	O
and	O
streams	O
which	O
seemed	O
from	O
the	O
wide	O
stony	O
margin	O
on	O
each	O
side	O
of	O
them	O
to	O
be	O
subject	O

It	O
takes	O
a	O

running	O
strong	O

to	O
sweep	O
the	O
outside	O

At	O
every	O
station	O
there	O
were	O
groups	O
of	O
people	O
,	O
sometimes	O
crowds	O
,	O
and	O
in	O
all	O
sorts	O
of	O
attire	O

Some	O
of	O
them	O
were	O
just	O
like	O
the	O
peasants	O
at	O
home	O
or	O
those	O
I	O
saw	O
coming	O
through	O
France	O
and	O
Germany	O
,	O
with	O
short	O
jackets	O
and	O
round	O
hats	O
and	O
home-made	O
trousers	O
;	O
but	O
others	O
were	O
very	O
picturesque	O
.	O

The	O
women	O
looked	O
pretty	O
,	O
except	O
when	O
you	O
got	O
near	O
them	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
were	O
very	O
clumsy	O
about	O
the	O
waist	O
.	O

They	O
had	O
all	O
full	O
white	O
sleeves	O
of	O
some	O
kind	O
or	O
other	O
,	O
and	O
most	O
of	O
them	O
had	O
big	O
belts	O
with	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
strips	O
of	O
something	O
fluttering	O
from	O
them	O
like	O
the	O
dresses	O
in	O
a	O
ballet	O
,	O
but	O
of	O
course	O
there	O
were	O
petticoats	O
under	O
them	O
.	O

The	O
strangest	O
figures	O
we	O
saw	O
were	O
the	O
Slovaks	O
,	O
who	O
were	O
more	O
barbarian	O
than	O
the	O
rest	O
,	O
with	O
their	O
big	O
cow-boy	O
hats	O
,	O
great	O
baggy	O
dirty-white	O
trousers	O
,	O
white	O
linen	O
shirts	O

and	O
enormous	O
heavy	O
leather	O
belts	O
,	O
nearly	O
a	O
foot	O
wide	O
,	O
all	O
studded	O
over	O
with	O
brass	O

They	O
wore	O
high	O
boots	O

with	O
their	O

tucked	O

them	O

and	O
had	O
long	O
black	O
hair	O

heavy	O
black	O

They	O
are	O
very	O
picturesque	O
,	O
but	O
do	O
not	O
look	O
prepossessing	O
.	O

On	O
the	O
stage	O
they	O
would	O
be	O
set	O
down	O
at	O
once	O
as	O
some	O
old	O
Oriental	O
band	O
of	O
brigands	O

They	O
are	O

however	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
told	O

very	O
harmless	O
and	O
rather	O
wanting	O

He	O
mumbled	EVENT
out	O
that	O
the	O
money	O
had	O
been	O
sent	O
in	O
a	O
letter	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
was	O
all	O
he	O
knew	O
.	O

When	O
I	O
asked	EVENT
him	O
if	O
he	O
knew	O
Count	O
Dracula	O
,	O
and	O
could	O
tell	O
me	O
anything	O
of	O
his	O
castle	O
,	O
both	O
he	O
and	O
his	O
wife	O
crossed	EVENT
themselves	O
,	O
and	O
,	O
saying	EVENT
that	O
they	O
knew	O
nothing	O
at	O
all	O
,	O
simply	O
refused	EVENT
to	O
speak	O
further	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
so	O
near	O
the	O
time	O
of	O
starting	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
no	O
time	O
to	O
ask	O
any	O
one	O
else	O
,	O
for	O
it	O
was	O
all	O
very	O
mysterious	O
and	O
not	O
by	O
any	O
means	O
comforting	O
.	O

Just	O
before	O
I	O
was	O
leaving	O
,	O
the	O
old	O
lady	O
came	EVENT
up	O
to	O
my	O
room	O
and	O
said	EVENT
in	O
a	O
very	O
hysterical	O
way	O
:	O
"	O
Must	O
you	O
go	O
?	O

Oh	O
!	O

young	O
Herr	O
,	O
must	O
you	O
go	O
?	O
"	O

She	O
was	O
in	O
such	O
an	O
excited	O
state	O
that	O
she	O
seemed	O
to	O
have	O
lost	O
her	O
grip	O
of	O
what	O
German	O
she	O
knew	O
,	O
and	O
mixed	EVENT
it	O
all	O
up	O
with	O
some	O
other	O
language	O
which	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
at	O
all	O
.	O

I	O
was	O
just	O
able	O
to	O
follow	EVENT
her	O
by	O
asking	O
many	O
questions	EVENT
.	O

When	O
I	O
told	EVENT
her	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
go	O
at	O
once	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
engaged	O
on	O
important	O
business	O
,	O
she	O
asked	EVENT
again	O
:	O
"	O
Do	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
day	O
it	O
is	O
?	O
"	O

I	O
answered	EVENT
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
fourth	O
of	O
May	O
.	O

She	O
shook	EVENT
her	O
head	O
as	O
she	O
said	EVENT
again	O
:	O
"	O
Oh	O
,	O
yes	O
!	O

I	O
know	O
that	O
!	O

I	O
know	O
that	O

but	O
do	O
you	O
know	O
what	O
day	O
it	O

"	O

On	O
my	O
saying	EVENT
that	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
understand	O
,	O
she	O
went	EVENT
on	O
:	O
"	O
It	O
is	O
the	O
eve	O
of	O
St.	O
George	O

Day	O

all	O
the	O

She	O
was	O
in	O
such	O
evident	O
distress	O
that	O
I	O
tried	EVENT
to	O
comfort	O
her	O
,	O
but	O
without	O
effect	O
.	O

Finally	O
she	O
went	EVENT
down	O
on	O
her	O
knees	O
and	O
implored	EVENT
me	O
not	O
to	O
go	O
;	O
at	O
least	O
to	O
wait	O
a	O
day	O
or	O
two	O
before	O
starting	O
.	O

It	O
was	O
all	O
very	O
ridiculous	O
but	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
feel	O
comfortable	O
.	O

However	O
,	O
there	O
was	O
business	O
to	O
be	O
done	O
,	O
and	O
I	O
could	O
allow	O
nothing	O
to	O
interfere	O
with	O
it	O
.	O

I	O
therefore	O
tried	EVENT
to	O
raise	O
her	O
up	O
,	O
and	O
said	EVENT
,	O
as	O
gravely	O
as	O
I	O
could	O
,	O
that	O
I	O
thanked	O
her	O
,	O
but	O
my	O
duty	O
was	O
imperative	O
,	O
and	O
that	O
I	O
must	O
go	O

She	O
then	O
rose	EVENT
and	O
dried	EVENT
her	O
eyes	O
,	O
and	O
taking	EVENT
a	O
crucifix	O
from	O
her	O
neck	O
offered	EVENT
it	O
to	O
me	O

I	O
did	O
not	O

what	O
to	O
do	O
,	O
for	O
,	O
as	O
an	O
English	O
Churchman	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
taught	O
to	O
regard	O
such	O
things	O
as	O
in	O
some	O
measure	O
idolatrous	O
,	O
and	O
yet	O
it	O
seemed	O
so	O
ungracious	O
to	O
refuse	O
an	O
old	O
lady	O
meaning	O
so	O
well	O
and	O
in	O
such	O
a	O

She	O

I	O

the	O

in	O
my	O
face	O

for	O
she	O
put	EVENT
the	O
rosary	O
round	O
my	O

and	O
said	EVENT
,	O
"	O
For	O
your	O

and	O
went	EVENT
out	O

the	O
