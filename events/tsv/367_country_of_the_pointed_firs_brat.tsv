The	O

THERE	O
WAS	O
SOMETHING	O
about	O
the	O
coast	O
town	O
of	O

which	O
made	O
it	O
seem	O
more	O

than	O
other	O
maritime	O
villages	O
of	O
eastern	O

Perhaps	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
simple	O
fact	O
of	O
acquaintance	O
with	O
that	O
neighborhood	O
which	O
made	O
it	O
so	O
attaching	O
,	O
and	O
gave	O
such	O
interest	O
to	O
the	O
rocky	O
shore	O
and	O
dark	O
woods	O
,	O
and	O
the	O
few	O
houses	O
which	O
seemed	O
to	O
be	O
securely	O
wedged	O
and	O
tree-nailed	O
in	O
among	O
the	O
ledges	O
by	O
the	O

These	O
houses	O
made	O
the	O
most	O

their	O

there	O
was	O
a	O
gayety	O

If	O
